2026 is the best time to get into Formula 1.

I'll convince you in the time it takes to read this article.

First, if you don't know what Formula 1 is:

22 millionaires race the fastest go-karts in the world, across the world, built by 11 companies that are run by literal supervillains.

The competition isn't just on track though, it's as much about business and technology as it is about racing. The teams are run like tech companies, constantly trying to push the limits of science and engineering, while also working against finance regulations from the FIA.

The team principals, or bosses, are basically trying to source the best talent to build the best care while they hire the best driver. And they're all fighting about it, constantly.

It's kind of like Game of Thrones…but with cars.

Let's get some FAQ's out of the way.

**"Aren't they just driving in circles?"**

Technically yes but actually no. The tracks have corners, straights, turns, hairpins and enough variety to produce actual races, and not just Sunday drives. It's not NASCAR, they don't drive in a big circle.

**"Ok but it's all bullshit because whoever has the fastest car wins right? There's nothing else to it."**

Yeah that's a common misconception. Tire strategy, driver error/skill, the pitcrew, the weather, timing of safety cars, car setup, the phase of the moon or anything of 1000 other variables can account for someone who doesn't have the fastest car winning a race.

And I think that really covers it. If you can accept these two things, congratulations. You're ready to become an F1 fan.

## So, why 2026?

It's a huge reset year.

The car regulations are completely new and are gonna be extremely different from anything from the last 10 years. New aerodynamics, new engine formula.

Which means it's almost a reset on what to expect across the board. Everything that happened in 2025 could mean nothing for 2026.

The cars are gonna be smaller, lighter…and slower.

Which is good. Means we'll get more racing and tighter maneuvers.

And since no one, driver or constructor, is an expert in these types of cars yet, we'll get more surprises.

2026 is also bringing a shake up to the teams itself.

While 2025 saw huge shakeups to the driver's line ups with a bunch of new drivers, switches and swaps, 2026 brings us two new teams.

**Audi** is coming to take over **Sauber**, and bring their own engine.

**Cadillac** is a brand new 11th team on the grid.

**Alpine**, **Aston Martin**, **Red Bull** and **Racing Bulls** are all going with new engine providers for this year too, with the Bulls bringing in **Ford** as an engine manufacturer.

With all these switches and resets, no one really knows what to expect.

And that's exactly why 2026 is such a good time to start watching.

If you're curious about F1, right now is the offseason. There are a few easy things you can do to kill some time until the [season starts in March](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2026).

F1 put out a [highlight reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiaVcT3SZv0) of every race from the 2025 season in one video. Lucky for us, the first race of the year in Australia was a banger, so you'll immediately see whether the sport is something you'd be interested in. Watching the whole thing, even on a second monitor while you work or game, gives you a solid feel for how a season actually unfolds.

If you want more context, check out [*P1 with Matt and Tommy*](https://www.youtube.com/@mattp1tommy). They're two chill guys who know a lot about F1, break things down without the corporate nonsense, and are genuinely entertaining.

And then in February, when Netflix drops the next season of [*Drive to Survive*](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890), watch that too.

The next F1 article will be my opinion on each team and driver going into 2026.
