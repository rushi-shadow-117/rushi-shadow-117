The cycle repeats. We spent the last four years building infrastructure for infrastructure. We built bridges to nowhere, L2s for L1s that nobody uses, and governance tokens for protocols that govern nothing.

It is time to admit that **shipping is the only metric**.

## The Infrastructure Trap

Engineers love building tools. It's safe. If you build a tool, you aren't responsible for the end-user experience. You just provide the shovel. But when everyone is selling shovels and nobody is digging for gold, the economy collapses.

We need to stop optimizing for throughput and start optimizing for utility.
